Yet, the mechanisms by which network structures affect individual learning and decision-making remain unclear. Here, by combining a real-time distributed learning task with functional magnetic resonance imaging, computational modeling and social network analysis, we studied how humans learn from observing others’ decisions on seven-node networks with varying topological structures. We show that learning on social networks can be approximated by a well-established error-driven...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/spektor-et-al-2023/">Spektor et al.

This loss aversion in decision making is commonly understood as a stable individual preference that is manifested across different contexts. The presumed stability and generality, which underlies the prominence of loss aversion in the literature at large, has been recently questioned by studies showing how loss aversion can disappear, and even reverse, as a function of the choice context. The present study investigated whether loss aversion reflects a trait-like...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/zorowitz-niv-2023/">Zorowitz &amp; Niv (2023)</a></h3></div><div class="post-subtitle"><h4>Data from two-step task pilots</h4></div><div class="post-links"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/2TGJD"> [Data]</a></div><div class="post-content"><p>Data from N&#x3D;149 participants who completed a gamified version of the two-step task under one of three conditions: (1) stimuli from both first- and second-state choices were randomly assigned to right&#x2F;left positions on the screen on every trial; (2) stimuli from both first- and second-state choices were assigned fixed right&#x2F;left positions on the screen (i.e., unchanging across trials); or (3) stimuli from first-state choices were randomly assigned to right&#x2F;left positions on the screen on every trial.
