Here, however, we show that in many situations planning can be made more efficient by relying on backward predictions, from a given outcome to the states that typically precede it. This holds specifically in environments where the number of states an agent may occupy increases with time (i.e., in diverging environments), because in such environments, backward predictions can be more compactly represented than forward...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/snijder-et-al-2023/">Snijder et al.

Some perspectives deny that there even exists a unified psychometric cognitive control construct to be measured at all. These shortcomings of the current literature may reflect the fact that current cognitive control paradigms are optimized for the detection of within-subject experimental effects rather than individual...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i><a class="tag" href="/opendata/tags/cognitive-control/" title="cognitive control">cognitive control </a><a class="tag" href="/opendata/tags/test-retest/" title="test-retest">test-retest </a><a class="tag" href="/opendata/tags/longitudinal/" title="longitudinal">longitudinal </a></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/vives-et-al-2023/">Vives et al.

We move beyond this traditional framework to explore the hypothesis that conceptual representations of uncertainty influence risky choice. Results reveal that uncertainty concepts are represented along a dimension that jointly captures probabilistic and valenced features of the conceptual space. These uncertainty representations predict the degree to which an individual engages in risky decision-making. Moreover, we find that most individuals have two largely distinct...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/zorowitz-et-al-2023a/">Zorowitz et al.

In a first study, we calibrate the psychometric functioning of the items in the MaRs-IB in a large sample adults participants (N&#x3D;1501).
