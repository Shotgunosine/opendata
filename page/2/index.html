They seemingly fail to recognize, for instance, that only the direct causes of an event can affect its probability (the Markov condition). How can one explain this paradox? Here we argue that standard normative analyses of causal reasoning mostly apply to the idealized case where the reasoner has perfect confidence in her knowledge of the underlying causal model. Given uncertainty about the correct representation of a causal system, it is not always rational for a...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i><a class="tag" href="/opendata/tags/causal-reasoning/" title="causal reasoning">causal reasoning </a></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/rmus-et-al-2023a/">Rmus et al.

RL models consider any response type indiscriminately, ranging from more concretely defined motor choices (pressing a key with the index finger), to more general choices that can be executed in a number of ways (selecting dinner at the restaurant). However, does the learning process vary as a function of the choice type?
