In such settings, individuals often lack insight into what interaction partners deem fair and appropriate, potentially seeding misunderstandings, frustration, and conflict. Here, we examine how individuals decipher distinct rules of engagement and adapt their behavior to reach agreements with partners from other cultural groups. Modeling individuals as Bayesian learners with inequality aversion reveals that individuals, in...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/das-steyvers-2023/">Das &amp; Steyvers (2023)</a></h3></div><div class="post-subtitle"><h4>Older adults catch up to younger adults on cognitive tasks after extended training</h4></div><div class="post-links"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/6jd3c">[Paper] </a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://osf.io/wbrq2/"> [Data]</a></div><div class="post-content"><p>Cognitive decline often accompanies natural aging, which results in younger adults outperforming older adults, on average, on tasks requiring attention, memory, or mental flexibility skills. This performance gap between age groups persists even after people train on these tasks, but it remains unclear whether the gap persists when individuals, rather than groups, are compared at different training levels. In this paper, we analyzed 9,923 users between 18-90 years old (63% over 60) who performed a variety of cognitive tasks on an online cognitive training platform.

While the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in tracking both mental effort demands and net value of rewards, these findings primarily come from choice paradigms that confound increased task difficulty with decreased reward probability. To resolve this issue, we designed novel tasks that kept probability of success – and therefore probability of reward – constant between levels of effort demand. In two experiments, participants completed a novel effort-based...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/barnby-et-al-2023/">Barnby et al.

Haloperidol, compared to placebo, enhanced the impact of partner behaviour on beliefs about harmful intent, and increased learning from recent encounters.
