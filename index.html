An individual’s computational phenotype is defined as a set of mechanistically interpretable parameters obtained from fitting computational models to behavioral data. However, the interpretation of these parameters hinges critically on their psychometric properties, which are rarely studied. In order to identify the sources governing the temporal variability of the computational phenotype, we carried out a 12-week longitudinal study...</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="meta"><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i></div></div></div></div><div class="post animated fadeInDown"><div class="post-title"><h3><a href="/opendata/navidi-et-al-2023/">Navidi et al.

However less is known about whether children are sensitive to gaps in their knowledge, and whether they selectively solicit information about items they previously indicated having a knowledge gap about. In a cross-situational word-learning task, we asked 5-year-olds, 6-9-year-olds and adults to estimate their knowledge of newly learned word-object associations.

In those situations, people typically choose as if they underestimate the probability of a rare outcome happening. Separately, people have been shown to overestimate the probability of an extreme outcome happening. Here, for the first time, we examine the confluence of these two competing biases in decisions from experience.
